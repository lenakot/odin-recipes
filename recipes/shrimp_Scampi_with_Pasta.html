    <div><i>Steps</i>
        <p><b>Prep ahead </b>Have all of your ingredients prepared and ready to cook before heating your skillet. You
            don't want to have to pause to cut, chop, squeeze, or measure right in the middle of a fast-moving recipe.
            If you use fresh shrimp, you can peel and devein the shrimp earlier in the day, then keep it chilled in the
            refrigerator until you're ready to get cooking.

        </p>
        <p><b>Cook the pasta first. </b>Boil the pasta in well-salted water, drain, and hold aside before cooking the
            shrimp scampi. You'll add the pasta to the hot skillet to warm it before serving. Time your cooking so
            you're ready to start cooking the shrimp immediately after the pasta is drained; you don't want the pasta to
            sit for too long.</p>
        <p><b>Don't overcook the shrimp. </b>It takes just a couple of minutes to cook raw shrimp, and if they cook for
            too long, shrimp turn tough and rubbery. You'll know the shrimp are close to done when they start to curl
            into a C shape and turn from translucent gray to opaque pink and white.</p>
        <p><b>Bonus tip. </b>Before you drain the pasta, hold aside a half cup of the pasta water to add to the sauce if
            the finished dish looks a little dry (you may not have to add the entire half cup). Pasta water is a pasta
            cook's secret weapon. The starchy water adds extra flavor and moistness to the recipe, gives sauces a
            smoother texture, and helps bind the sauce to the pasta. </p>
